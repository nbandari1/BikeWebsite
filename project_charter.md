## Bike Website

### 1. Introduction

This project is about building a bike website where customers can easily explore, compare, and buy bikes online. The goal is to make bike shopping simple, smooth, and enjoyable. Instead of visiting different stores, users can find everything in one place from viewing detailed specs and customer reviews to checking real-time stock and booking test rides. The website focuses on helping customers make better decisions by giving them all the information and tools they need. Itâ€™s designed to look modern, work fast, and make the online bike shopping experience stress-free.
