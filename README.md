## Problem  

Customers interested in purchasing bikes most of the time struggle to find clear, centralized, and convenient information online. They are not able to easily browse available models, explore categories (such as cruiser or sport), or stay updated about new releases. Additionally, many customers face challenges finding the nearest dealers where they can purchase or test ride the bikes. This lack of accessibility and convenience reduces customer engagement and makes the buying journey harder than it should be.

## Solution  

To solve these customer issues, our team will build a web app. This app will let users find bikes, filter by category, locate dealers, and sign up for updates all in one place. The front end will be built with React and CSS to display a clean catalog of bike models. Users can easily filter by type like cruiser or sport and sign up their email to get updates on new bike releases. The back end will use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB; they will manage all the data for bikes, categories, dealers, and subscriptions making sure that everything is stored and accessed reliably. A dealer finder will show the nearest authorized sellers using location data. While the catalog and category pages will help customers easily browse and compare bike models and prices. The team will work together on both the front end and back end. Two members will handle the design aspect and the user experience (using Figma and React), while two others will work on the server and database integration. This way everyone can work at the same time and stay coordinated during the first sprint.

## Technologies  

Our project will be developed using the MERN stack to ensure both scalability and efficiency. The frontend will be built with React and CSS, allowing us to design a user-friendly interface where customers can easily browse, filter, and explore bike models. For the backend, we will use Node.js with Express.js to create a fast and reliable server that can handle API requests for bikes, categories, dealers, and subscriptions. MongoDB will be used as the database, providing flexible and efficient storage of bike information, user subscriptions, and dealer data. Additionally, tools like Figma will be used for prototyping the UI design and planning the user experience before implementation. This technology stack ensures seamless communication between the client and server, making the website responsive, interactive, and capable of handling future scalability.
